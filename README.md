Recognising and avoiding phishing attacks
       Phishing attacks are a major cyber threat where attackers pose as legitimate entities to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information. These scams can take many forms, such as fake emails from banks requesting account verification or malicious links disguised as shipment tracking. Understanding different types of phishing is essential: email phishing involves generic emails with malicious links; spear phishing targets specific individuals with personalised messages; whaling focuses on high-profile executives like CEOs; smishing uses SMS messages for scams, and vishing involves phone-based deception. Phishing emails often have common red flags such as suspicious sender addresses (e.g., “support@bànk.com”), poor grammar, urgent calls to action, strange attachments, and promises of unrealistic rewards. Phishing websites can be identified by checking for insecure URLs (missing “https”), domain mismatches (like “amaz0n.com”), fake security warnings, and unnecessary personal information requests.
       Phishing attackers also use social engineering tactics, manipulating people psychologically to extract confidential data. This includes impersonating a trusted colleague or superior, leveraging emotions like fear or urgency to push for immediate actions, and pretexting—creating false scenarios to justify requests for personal information (e.g., pretending to be from IT). Staying safe from phishing attacks requires a multi-pronged approach. Users should always verify emails and links by hovering over URLs to check the destination, enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to add an extra layer of security, and avoid sharing personal information through email or text. Any phishing attempts should be promptly reported to the organisation’s IT or security team. Additionally, anti-phishing tools, like browser extensions and email filters, provide extra protection.
       If someone falls victim to a phishing attack, immediate action is crucial. They should change their passwords, contact their bank or financial institutions to freeze or block compromised accounts and report the incident to cybercrime authorities. Monitoring accounts for suspicious activity will also help mitigate further damage. Key takeaways from phishing awareness training include remaining cautious with unexpected emails or messages, always verifying identities and links, and recognising that security is a shared responsibility—everyone must stay vigilant to protect personal and organisational data. With awareness and the right precautions, phishing attacks can be effectively mitigated.
